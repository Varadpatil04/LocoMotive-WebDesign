# Locomotive.js Project


"This project is built using Locomotive.js to provide a smooth scrolling experience and enhance performance for animations on the website."

## Overview:

This project aims to implement a modern web design using Locomotive.js for smooth scrolling and advanced animations. Locomotive.js is integrated with minimal effort, and additional libraries can be used for extended functionality such as GSAP or ScrollMagic.

- **Smooth Scrolling**: Adds inertia and parallax effects for smoother transitions.
- **Performance Optimized**: Lazy loading, optimized assets, and event handling ensure the best performance.
- **Customizable Scroll**: Easily adjust speed, damping, and smoothness.
- **Compatible with other animation libraries**: Integrates well with GSAP, ScrollMagic, and others.
